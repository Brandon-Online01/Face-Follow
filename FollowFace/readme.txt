I built this to test my kill skill in JS but not as yet dude, gotta work a little more but this face detection and tenseflow models are a mustee these are cool
add your comments i am reading and trying to find out how i can follow the face faster, draw lines around eyes ears etc and be able to show the possible expression 
based on facial expression.
this is gonna take a while before i commit the new changes 
until then farewell lol
